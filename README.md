RssRead
=======

It's my first android app. I want to use it to start my android learning. the other hand for commemorating google reader service ending


The day from the google reader closed, I started to implement my rss reader. it can offline store the feeds. Now the basic functions has

completed, I think those functions has reached my requirements. I decide to stop continues refine the app temporary. But a new idea come

from my brain, which I want to implments a web site that can also provide rss reader functions. my purpose is to learn play framework and 

MongoDb, At the same time I want to improve my design defect which in the android app. I hope I can try DDD for it.
